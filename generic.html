								<p>Born in the cultural capital of India, Chennai, I have been exposed to multiple environments, before I began my formal schooling in Bangalore. During my formative years, I was a cricket enthusiast, both as a player and as a spectator. On evenings, you could either find me in the playground, or at a friend's place watching cricket together. Cricket as a sport has myriad learnings associated with it, and I left no stone unturned to enjoy every bit of it. As I made it to Delhi Public School, Bangalore North, I was amazed by the lush green campus. Time was spent studying during the day, and playing post classes. At the age of 12, I began swimming post classes. This eventually improved my health, in terms of building endurance and enhancing fitness. I loved mathematics from a very young age. I would spend time solving pattern questions, analysing data, and looking at graphs. In class 5, I won a subject proficiency award for the Sanskrit course, ranked #1 in my batch. I had a knack at grasping languages, and had perfected reading and writing in Kannada, Tamil, and Hindi during middle school.</p>
								<p>Elders in my home spent a considerable amount of time listening to classical music, and unsurprisingly enough, I picked a liking for it as well. I began learning Carnatic Violin under the guidance of Violin maestro, Dr. L Subramanian. I thoroughly enjoyed my weekends as I spent learning violin, and this went on till the end of my senior secondary school. I was also an avid follower of chess. I spent my free time watching videos of grandmasters playing various tournaments, and would often enact these, playing chess with my family or friends. </p>
								<p>At high school, I was part of a long-drawn journey to explore Mathematics, Science, and their convergence. The experiments in laboratories was what I used to look forward to at the beginning of each week. Eventually, I took up Science as my major for senior secondary school. The two years spent thereof were one of the most memorable ones in my life. I was part of a group of ambitious and curious friends who taught me more about life than books could ever do. Post my school, I began my engineering studies at Vellore Institute of Technology University. My engineering days were more about me understanding myself: my interests, goals, strengths, and weaknesses. The first two years spent on campus were something I cherish till date.</p>
								<p>March 10th, 2020: We received a message from our college, stating that classes would now be shifted home. Little did we know, that we were about to be part of a global struggle against COVID thereafter. Post this, it suddenly felt that I had a lot of time in hand. I used this time, to traverse through online certifications. Coursera, Udemy, IBM, and what not. These were my go-to every morning for a while. I learnt cutting-edge technologies: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, Internet of Things, etc. I was quite amazed by advancements in the technological sphere, and sought to experience these first-hand, by working on personal projects. I enjoyed working on data science, to solve real-world problems. I worked at multiple internships and wrote research papers during this time. It was in my penultimate year, that I began contemplating on my career options post engineering. From the beginning, I wanted to have a career in marketing: I was inspired by the strategy and advertising that goes into it, and the opportunities and impact that it could create for a company. Researching through the internet, I concluded that a postgraduate degree of MBA in India was a good path for me. This led me to begin my preparations for entrance tests, personal interviews, and group discussions: in short, the whole admission process. Balancing these along with college studies, internships, and drafting research papers initially seemed like a herculean task. Carrying this process out succesfully required me to be meticulous with time management. </p>
								<p>November 6th, 2021: A series of floods struck Chennai, causing a majority of the localities to be inundated, and mine being close to the sea fell victim as well. Unfortunately, this fell in line with the schedule of my entrance exams to MBA. The next few weeks were a test of persistence, patience, and poise. Multiple cancellations of exams, frequent powercuts at homes, physical illness among family members, were a few of the hurdles that I faced during this period. Things culminated well in January, however, as I received calls from top business schools across India. </p>
								<p>March 10th, 2022: Exactly 2 years post the beginning of the lockdown, I was thrilled to have had received an admit to the Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Pune, for their flagship MBA program. The journey till here was a testament of discipline and diligence. My MBA began in June, and I have been grateful to the opportunities received yet. I look forward to add value to my organization across sales and marketing roles, by leveraging technical tools, and deriving actionable insights.  </p>
