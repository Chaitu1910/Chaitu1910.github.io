									<h2>A Brief Note:</h2>
									<p>Theory learnt in classrooms when applied in practice, can work wonders. I set out to explore real-world applications of skills that I learnt in college. Below, I throw some light about my experiences.</p>

										<h2>Product Development Intern</h2>
										<p>Yuktix Technologies, Bangalore, India</br>
										December 2020</p>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic10.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Yuktix is an agri-tech startup, focused on developing next-generation agriculture solutions using Machine Learning, IoT, and Cloud analytics. My role was focused on product diversification. Yuktix operated on cash crops to develop automated weather monitoring systems. I performed market research to gauge the opportunity, and concluded that the coffee sector was a potential market for Yuktix. Further, I researched into key issues that could be solved using Yuktix's products. Disease and pest prevention was the main potential area. To get relevant insights, I collaborated with research scientists from the Coffee Board of India, an independent body that caters to the coffee sector across the country. I eventually prepared a deck to present the solution to present Yuktix's solution to the Coffee Board of India in an attempt to expand Yuktix's presence.   </p>

										<h2>Analyst Intern</h2>
										<p>Heaven Greens Supermarket, Chennai, India</br>
										April 2021</p>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Heaven Greens is a supermarket situated close to my house in Chennai, with me being a regular patron to their place. The store maintains an excel sheet to record all transactions in multiple branches across the city. In a casual conversation with the manager, he presented the excel sheet to me. I further analyzed the data to produce actionable insights. My results enabled the manager to make data-driven decisions with respect to sourcing, delivery, and inventory management. I presented a dashboard to the manager, that gets updated in real-time with appropriate input. I also educated the manager and staff with various mathematical functions and shortcut keys in the Microsoft Excel software.</p>
